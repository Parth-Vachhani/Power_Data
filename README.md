# Power_Data (Complete Project):

## Aim of this Project:
- Compare the available data of this country with the United states or an other country if you want.
- Generate charts from the extracted data, also generate comparative diagrams as many as make sense to you.
- Find out so much information as possible. What information was stored there? What entries can you find for special column contents?

- git push

### Exploratory data analysis:
1. Loading data sets.
2. Find out the shape of the data.
3. Total null value present in the dataset.
4. Check datatypes.

### Data Cleaning:
1. Drop all those unnecessary columns with all the null values and will not require further analysis.
2. Dropping the null rows from the dataset, as they will be having unique entries only.
3. Adding new updated columns.

### Visualization:
