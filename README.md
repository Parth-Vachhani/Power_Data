# Power_Data
Project made from my side with having basic knowledge of Python. 
I have created this Python file as per my knowledge. Making comparison of two different places "United State(Los Angeles)" and "Germany(Frankfurt)".
I have first of all done cleaning, removing unwanted columns, renaming the columns and than compared data as per month.
Thank You
